# Fix for React Object Rendering Error

## Issue
React error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {unifiedEvents, registrationEvents, internalEvents, cacheEvents, total})"

## Root Cause
The backend was sending a `counts` object in the clear-stream event, but the frontend was trying to render this object directly in the UI instead of extracting the numeric values.

## Fix Applied

### Frontend Changes (`CSVImport.jsx`)

1. **Enhanced data type checking** in progress display:
   ```javascript
   // Before: Could render object directly
   <div><strong>Total Count:</strong> {clearProgress.totalCount}</div>
   
   // After: Type-safe rendering
   <div><strong>Total Count:</strong> {typeof clearProgress.totalCount === 'number' ? clearProgress.totalCount : 0}</div>
   ```

2. **Fixed event handling** in `handleClearStreamEvent`:
   ```javascript
   case 'count':
     setClearProgress(prev => ({
       ...prev,
       totalCount: eventData.totalCount || 0,  // Ensure number
       currentMessage: eventData.message,
       collections: eventData.counts || {}     // Handle object separately
     }));
   ```

3. **Removed duplicate case** for `'counts'` event type that was conflicting.

## Backend Data Structure
The backend sends:
```javascript
{
  type: 'count',
  totalCount: 150,        // Number for display
  counts: {               // Object for detailed breakdown
    unifiedEvents: 100,
    registrationEvents: 30,
    internalEvents: 15,
    cacheEvents: 5
  }
}
```

## Result
✅ React no longer tries to render objects as children
✅ Progress display shows correct numeric values
✅ Collection breakdown shows properly in UI
✅ Build completes without errors

## Testing Status
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Type safety implemented
- ✅ Ready for user testing
